# leaderboard-discord-bot

Welcome to the Leaderboard Discord Bot side project! I have created this Discord Bot as part of a 90 days discipline challenge to help me and 
my friends to achieve our goals for the new year of 2021. The goal of the challenge is to develop the winner mentality and become a finisher. 

The leaderboard automatically tracks the number of successful days each person has so far (i.e. the number of days they achieved all of their daily goals).

Here are all the leaderboard commands that the discpline challenge leaderbaord currently supports:
!leaderboard: Display the discipline challenge leaderboard
!success: Add a successful day to your score
!help: Display this commands meanu
!remove: Remove yourself from the discipline challenge
!removeall: Remove all participants from the board
!decrease: Decrease your days count by 1
!reset: Reset your days count back to 0
!info: Display all the info about the discipline challenge
!add n: Add n days to your total score (example: use !add 7 to add 7 days)
!eval: Run javascript code in the background 


The source code can be found under the src folder in the repo. Enjoy:).
